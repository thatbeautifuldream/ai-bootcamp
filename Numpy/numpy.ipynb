Then your program should display the equivalent amount of time in the form D:HH:MM:SS, where D, HH,MM,and SS represent days, hours, minutes and seconds respectively. The hours, minutes and seconds should all be formatted so that they occupy exactly two digits. Use your research skills determine what additional character needs to be included in the format specifier so that leading zeros are used instead of leading spaces when a number is formatted to a particular width."

Within the formula Ta is the air temperature in degrees Celsius and V is the wind speed in kilometers per hour. A similar formula with different constant values can be used for temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and wind speeds in miles per hour.\n",
